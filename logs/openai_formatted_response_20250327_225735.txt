Discuss the purpose of this test.\n2.  Talk about AI language models like GPT-3.5-turbo.\n3.  Start a conversation on a completely random topic (like hobbies, current events, science, etc.).\n4.  Try a specific task (like writing a short story, explaining a concept, translating something).\n\nJust let me know what direction you'd like to go!"
